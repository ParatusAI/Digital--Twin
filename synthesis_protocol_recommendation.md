### Synthesis Procedure

1. **Preparation**
   - Heat reaction vessel to 190°C under inert atmosphere
   - Prepare stock solutions of CsBr and PbBr₂ in DMSO

2. **Injection**
   - Rapidly inject equal volumes of CsBr and PbBr₂ solutions
   - Maintain 1:1 molar ratio for optimal stoichiometry

3. **Ligand Addition**
   - Add oleic acid (0.4 mol/L) for surface passivation
   - Add oleylamine (0.2 mol/L) for size control

4. **Reaction**
   - Maintain 190°C for 75 minutes
   - Monitor color change to bright green

5. **Cooling and Purification**
   - Cool to room temperature
   - Purify via centrifugation with antisolvent

## Quality Control Guidelines

### Expected Indicators of Success
- **Visual**: Bright green colloidal solution
- **Phase purity**: >40% confidence for CsPbBr₃ 3D
- **Optical properties**: Emission peak ~14 nm, bandgap ~1.3 eV

### Troubleshooting
- **Low confidence (<35%)**: Increase temperature to 200°C
- **Mixed phases**: Check stoichiometry and reaction time
- **Poor optical properties**: Adjust ligand concentrations

## Model Limitations and Validation

**Important Notes:**
- Model predictions based on synthetic training data
- Experimental validation required for all parameters
- Confidence levels indicate relative probability, not absolute certainty
- Material property predictions should be verified experimentally

## Alternative Protocols

### High Temperature Protocol (42.6% confidence)
- Temperature: 200°C
- Same concentrations as optimal protocol
- Reduced reaction time: 45 minutes

### Extended Reaction Protocol (40.0% confidence)  
- Cs-Br: 1.4 mol/L, Pb-Br₂: 0.9 mol/L
- Temperature: 210°C
- Reaction time: 90 minutes
- Higher oleic acid: 0.6 mol/L

## Conclusion

The digital twin model suggests that balanced stoichiometry (1:1 Cs:Pb ratio) combined with elevated temperatures (190°C) and optimized ligand concentrations provides the highest probability of successful CsPbBr₃ 3D perovskite synthesis. DMSO is recommended as the optimal solvent system.

**Next Steps:**
1. Experimental validation of optimal protocol
2. Fine-tuning based on actual synthesis results  
3. Model retraining with experimental data for improved accuracy
